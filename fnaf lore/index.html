    <h1>My take on FNaF lore</h1>

William Afton’s story started in 1973 when him and an old friend by the name of Henry Emily worked together to create a family-friendly mascot diner by the name of Fredbear’s Family Diner.
At Fredbear’s, there were two mascots: Fredbear the Bear and Springbonnie the Bunny, both of which were golden in colour and were furry costumes worn by Henry and William. These characters quickly grew in popularity, and the friends became successful. 
However, there was only one Fredbear’s location, and that was in the small town of Hurricane, Utah. Not long after the first location opened, Bill and Henry invested in more locations across Utah. This helped them make lots of money, and further increased the popularity of Fredbear’s. As Fredbear’s trended, the friends decided to redesign the characters, and upgraded them from handmade furry costumes to state-of-the-art animatronics, capable of movement and communicating with the guests.
In the late 70’s to early 80’s, Henry and William became interested in spring-lock technology. Springlocks were tightly coiled springs that could lock into place and could snap back quickly. The two found that these locks could be used to make a hybrid animatronic that could snap back to allow a human to fit inside. The problem was that designing an animatronic robot to open was rather tricky, as it needed to be larger than a person but not so large that the animatronics couldn’t move around. To counter this, the springlocks had to be smaller and in larger quantity, specifically around the arms and face.

These springlock suits were revolutionary, as it made the animatronics look way less robotic in movement and was also shown to be less expensive than making two versions of each character. Local news stations noticed this and interviewed Henry and William about their amazing technology. In one of the interviews, Henry and William were asked if they were going to make new characters, and Henry revealed that he had been planning a new collection of characters, including a brown bear, blue bunny, yellow chicken and red fox. These characters wouldn’t be springlock suits; however they would be advanced animatronics that could freely walk around in the pizzerias.
Shortly after, the Prize Counters at every Fredbear’s location were filled with silly-looking plushies and masks which almost every child was wearing, all these masks and plushies being based off the characters mentioned in the interviews. Henry also created a TV series known as Freddy and Friends, which featured the new characters and revealed their names: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie Bunny, Chica Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox.
However, William wasn’t a fan of these new characters, and how basic they seemed. They were all primary colours, except for Freddy; but Freddy was just a fancy rip-off of Fredbear. Also, William wasn’t told about Henry’s plans before the interview, and William was a bit angry about it.
“If you’re not going to tell me about something, then neither will I,” William thought to himself as he drew up his own ideas. 
William designed a better version of Freddy, Bonnie and Foxy, along with 2 new characters, inspired by his daughter Elizabeth and his lovely wife, whose name could not be found on any records.

William’s versions of the characters would be referred to as the Funtimes, and they would have a shiny plastic shell instead of the furry bodies that Henry’s characters had. Freddy and Foxy would be white and pink/purple, Bonnie would be two blue and pink hand-puppets that would be attached to Freddy’s left arm, and the new characters Circus Baby and Ballora would be red-white-orange and blue-white respectively. They would have metal wires instead of the endoskeletons that the other animatronics had, as the wires moved smoothly and made movement look smooth and human-like. They would also have an Artificial Intelligence chip inside them that allowed them to have conversations with guests and each other.
These characters had interesting secret features, too.
Freddy could store cakes and pinatas inside his chest cavity and could transport children inside him too in case any young guests had wandered too far.
Foxy could mimic the voices of parents to lure children back to the main stage, which helped to keep children from getting lost.
Circus Baby had many features, such as:
•	Dancing
•	Singing
•	Inflating helium balloons at her fingertips
•	Even dispensing ice-cream!
As William designed the characters, he also had to figure out where he’d build a location without gaining too much attention from Henry. He chose to build the sister location underground, and underneath the Fredbear’s closest to his home. As William was working on this, he was getting his eldest son Mike, who was 16 at the time, to babysit his younger brother Garrett. Mike usually hung out with his friends at Fredbear’s, so he just brought Garrett along with him. However, Garrett gets scared easily, and Mike’s friends weren’t the best influence on Mike. Mike and his friends would tease Garrett and would even lock him in the Parts and Service room with all the spare robot parts. Garrett would then go on to develop a phobia of the animatronics, and Mike’s friends only made it worse.
Once, Garrett watched his father William fit a suit onto an employee, and Garrett’s childish mind saw it as the character eating the employee. Later that day, Garrett bumped into the same character and squealed in fear, curled up into a ball and sobbed for hours. He was then known as the Crying Child from that point onwards.
Garrett would have nightmares of these characters roaming his house, trying to get him at any moment, and the only protection he had was a flashlight. The nightmare versions of the characters had sharp claws, many teeth and exposed robotic parts. They made this horrid, distorted roar whenever they grabbed him, and they would sneak around in the dark, too.
Unfortunately, something tragic would happen to Garrett that week.
Garrett was yet again forced to go to Fredbear’s again by his brother Mike. Mike’s friends were there, all wearing the Freddy and Friends masks. Mike grabbed Garrett and said to his friends “Guys, I think the little man wants to give Fredbear a big kiss!”
Garrett said nothing, but tears rolled down his face. He desperately tried to wriggle free of Mike, but he was just too strong.
“On three! 1.. 2.. 3..” Mike said as the friends lifted Garrett up into Fredbear’s jaw.
Garrett screamed and cried as his head and part of his body was put in Fredbear’s mouth.
Suddenly, there was a loud crack. Garrett was silent.
Mike’s friends stared in horror as fresh blood started to drip from Fredbear’s jaw.
“Garrett?” said Mike. “Garrett?”
Tears began to form in Mike’s eyes.
“Garrett?” 
Mike’s voice started to break.
“I didn’t mean to..”
Mike fell to his knees. He ripped the Foxy mask off and started to cry.
The friends stood there, traumatised.
One friend threw up.
Another friend passed out.
The final friend screamed “CALL AN AMBULANCE!”

All the Fredbear locations were shut down that day.

After “The Bite” as people started to call it, William became very over-protective of his daughter Elizabeth and at the same time, was blaming Mike for what happened to Garrett. Henry had split up the business with William now that Fredbear’s was shut down, and Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria was the newest big thing. William was left with nothing apart from his plans for Circus Baby’s Pizza World, and there was a noticeable difference in William’s mental health. He started experimenting with the character’s AI and made some peculiar modifications to it. For example, Circus Baby would always count the number of children and adults in the room. If there were no adults and only one child, something bad would happen.
William could no longer trust Mike to babysit, so William took Elizabeth to the pizza place with him and made her sit in the office with him.
“Daddy, why won’t you let me play with her?”
“Daddy, she’s so pretty! Why can’t I play with her?”
“Daddy, she looks just like me! Didn’t you make her just for me?”
William denied Elizabeth’s requests to play with Circus Baby, and Elizabeth just wasn’t having it. So Elizabeth waited until her father wasn’t paying attention and snuck out of the office into the pizzeria, where Circus Baby was performing onstage. Everyone else was in the other rooms, so Elizabeth climbed onstage. Circus Baby started talking to Elizabeth, and her face lit up with delight.
 “She talks! This is amazing!” Elizabeth thought to herself.
There was a clicking sound, and a metal arm stuck out of CB’s torso. At the end of the arm was a vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top. Elizabeth stepped forward to grab it when CB dropped it. Elizabeth looked down at the ice cream, then up at Circus Baby. “Had her eyes always been green?” Elizabeth thought, when suddenly the metal arm grabbed her and pulled her toward CB. She started to scream as the arm dragged her inside CB’s body, killing her almost instantly.
Kids rushed into the room, drowning out the sound of Elizabeth screaming. William had noticed that Elizabeth was missing, and a dreadful thought popped into his mind. He ran out of the office and searched for Elizabeth when Circus Baby stared at him with green eyes and waved. William was horrified. Circus Baby’s eyes were supposed to be blue, not green like Elizabeth’s.

Circus Baby’s Pizza World was shut down that day.

William Afton had lost two of his children and two of his biggest projects in the same week. 
He was broken. He only had Mike left, and he hated Mike for what happened to Garrett. That’s the reason why he decided to drive to Henry’s house and talk to him. When he got there, Henry’s daughter Charlie answered the door.
“Is your dad home?” William said to Charlie.
When Henry heard William’s voice, he came to the door quickly. Charlie went back into the house, and William said, “I need your help.”
“Is this about your kids?”
“Part of it, yeah.”
“Want to come inside?”
“Uh, ok.”
When they were inside, William explained what had happened to Garrett and Elizabeth, the diners and everything else that had happened.
“So let me get this straight: you’re blaming your son for killing your other son and then make something that ends up killing your daughter?” Henry asked.
“That’s putting it one way.” William said.
“And you want to co-own my company?”
“I’ve got nothing else left.”
“William, you have stolen my characters and made them look bad. Two children have now died under the Fazbear name.”
“Yeah, my children!”
“I understand your reaction to the Bite-”
“Don’t call it that!”
“Ok, the incident at Fredbear’s, but the thing at Clown Baby’s world is nothing to do with me. That’s your problem, William. You’re the only one responsible for that. And to be honest, I don’t even know if I can trust you anymore.”
“Henry..” William said.
“I-I think it’s best if you leave, Will.”
William left Henry’s house, and anger started to take over him. 
“He’s calling me a murderer?!”
William pulled out of Henry’s driveway and began to drive above the speed limit. 
When William got home, he noticed Mike’s uncle Ryan sat on the seat in front of the tv. He walked over to Mike’s bedroom door and started knocking loudly.
“Leave him alone. He’s had a rough day” Ryan said.
William walked back out of the front door and went round to the back of the house.
Mike’s window was smashed and there was a line of footprints headed towards the nearest Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria.
“He’s ran off to that place again. He’ll be sorry when he gets back.”
William went back in the house and got a bottle of whiskey.
“So Ryan, what are you watching?”
“Just some show called ‘The Immortal and The Restless.’ Mike got me into it.”
“Nice. Oh yeah, have you seen Mike?”
“He was in his room, why?”
“Oh nothing, just that he ran away!”
“Wait, what?!”
“Yeah, real great job of babysitting you did.”
“Oh, crap.”
“It’s fine, I know where he’s headed, and I was just gonna go there.”
“Are you sure? You’ve just been drinking.”
“I’m fine. Alright, I’ll see ya in a minute.”
William grabbed the bottle of whiskey and the keys and got back in the car. He drove off in the direction of Freddy Fazbear’s.

“What do you mean, I’m banned?”
“Sorry, it says you’re not allowed inside. I don’t make the rules here; Mr Emily does.”
“Well, can you get Michael Afton and tell him his father’s waiting outside for him then?”
5 minutes later, Michael walked out of the pizzeria with a Golden Freddy plushie and a slice of pizza. He looked embarrassed.
“You’re gonna pay for smashing that window. You know that, right?”
“Yeah- wait, are you drunk?”
“Uh, no? Hurry up and get in the car!”
William snatched the pizza from Michael and took a bite.
“Bleugh! This tastes awful!” 
“I like it-”
“Shut up, Mike. Get in the car.”

William and Mike drive home in an awkward silence.
Mike began to speak. “So-”
“Shut up, Mike. You’re so grounded right now.”
“How are you gonna ground me if I don’t have a window?”
“I’m too pissed off at you to think right now.”
“Or you can just accept defeat..”
“Be quiet, smartarse. I know what I’m on about-”
“Watch out Dad, there’s a dog!”
William turned his head and sure enough, a dog had run into the middle of the road. He slammed the brakes so hard; Mike’s slice of pizza flew into the windshield.
Mike ran out of the car and checked on the dog. Thank goodness it wasn’t hurt. He looked around, and a young girl with a Chica gift bag was standing on the pavement, shouting “Max! Over here!”
Mike walked over to the girl and the dog followed.
“Thank you, sir!”
“Mike, and no problem! Cute dog, by the way. What’s his name?”
“His name is Max! He’s the bestest boy in the whole world!”
The girl fussed Max. “Who’s the bestest boy? You are!”
Mike looked at the girl’s gift bag. It had the name “Susie” written on it.
“Susie?” Mike asked.
“Yeah? How did you know?” she replied.
“Oh, it just says it on your bag. Nice to meet you, Susie!”
“Thanks, Mike. Here’s something for saving my dog.”
Susie reached into the bag and pulled out a lollipop.
Mike took the lollipop with an awkward smile on his face.
“Aww, I appreciate it! Thank you, Susie.”
At that point, William stuck his head out the car window and said,
“C’mon, Mike! We haven’t got enough time for chit-chat!”
Mike looked at his father, then back to Susie. He gave her a hug, then patted Max on the head. He then got up and walked to the car.
“What was that for, Mike?”
“I was just talking to the kind girl.”
“Kind girl,” William was mocking Mike. “What are you, 6? There’s no need to be ‘talking to the kind girl,’ Mike! You’re 16; you’re supposed to be cool, hanging out with friends and sneaking out-”
“Uh…”
“And that’s why you’re grounded. Just look at yourself, sneaking out to go to a crappy kid’s place. Well, from now on, I forbid you from going there.”
“But Dad, that’s not fair!”
“Well I don’t care. If I catch you there again, you’ll regret it.”
“Don’t you own Freddy’s?”
“THAT’S IT! You will remain silent for the rest of the journey!”
Mike opened his mouth to speak, then closed it and crossed his arms.

When they got home, Ryan was still watching The Immortal and The Restless. 
“Mike, you’re gonna wait here while I figure out how to fix your window. Ryan, watch him carefully.”
“Where was he?” Ryan asked.
“That crappy diner down the road.” William replied.
“Hold on, I thought you worked there?”
“Alright, both of you keep quiet! I will not have that name mentioned under my roof from now on!”
Mike and Ryan exchanged a look of confusion and suspicion.
William fetched the flashlight, hammer, nails and a few wooden planks. He then went round to the back of the house and began hammering the wooden planks over the window frame. Once he had finished, he grabbed a broom from the shed and swept the broken glass into a pile. He then grabbed a shovel and began to dig a hole. Once the hole was deep enough, he swept the glass in and covered it up.
“Right, that’s enough work for one day. I need a drink.”
He went back inside, poured himself a glass of whiskey, and went to search in the attic for an old, empty cardboard box. However, while he was up there, he couldn’t help but notice all the old things in there. The first Springbonnie costume, a box of Elizabeth’s baby clothes, a strange blue box with two padlocks on the front. Strange. William didn’t remember that being there. 
“Don’t get distracted. Focus. You just need to find a cardboard box.”
Not long after, William came back down with a cardboard box. He flattened it, then wedged it into Mike’s window frame. He then duct-taped it to the wall so that no cold air would get through. 
“That’ll do nicely. Mike! Get in here!”
Mike entered, and William sat down on the end of Mike’s bed.
“Listen, I need to talk to you. I feel like we’ve not talked properly since.. Garrett.”
Mike looked down in guilt.
“You’ve been a real jerk to Garrett for a while now. Am I right?”
“Yes, Father.”
“And you’ve caused him to develop a fear of my animatronics. Is that correct?”
“Yes, Father.”
“And you forced his head into a machine. And now he’s dead.”
“I didn’t mean to..”
“It doesn’t matter if it was by accident or not. He’s gone. We can’t just put him back together again. Can you see why I’ve been so harsh on you since then?”
“Yes, Father.”
“I don’t know what to do with you. I can’t exactly get rid of you because you’re my son. We haven’t got any family left, excepting Ryan, but he’s already got enough to deal with. So that’s why I’m grounding you. And I’ll be installing CCTV for the house, too. I can’t be having you break out again.”
“Yes, Father.”
“Now go to bed.”
William stood up and left the room, and Mike got in his bed.
As William shut the door, he sighed.
“If only Sarah were still here..” William said.
Ryan began to snore. He had fallen asleep on the couch while watching the TV. William yawned. He was getting tired, too.


William was confused. He felt like he knew where he was, but at the same time, he didn’t. He looked to the left. Arcade machines and white boxes with red stripes on them were all neatly aligned against the wall. He looked to the right. A ball pit with dusty, faded balls that had lost their colour over time. He looked down. His hands were big and metallic. One hand had blood on it. The other had a kitchen knife in it. He looked up. In front of him was the old Fredbear animatronic.
“What is this?” William thought to himself.
The Fredbear animatronic had empty eye-sockets and had strange maroon stains around the jaw and joints. There was a horrid metallic smell in the air.
“What the..”
William turned around. Behind him were the Freddy and Friends characters that Henry created. They were in terrible condition and smelled badly. William attempted to cover his nose, but he was blocked from doing so. That’s when he realised that he was in the old Springbonnie costume.
“It’s me,” said an unknown child’s voice.
William turned around. There were no children in sight. He looked back at the Fredbear animatronic, which now had glowing white pupils. The animatronic started to giggle. William recognised the voice.
“Garrett?”
At that moment, William heard the worst sound he could ever imagine. A quiet ticking sound, followed by a snap and the sound of metal scraping against metal. The Springlocks!
Before William knew it, he had been impaled all over his body by tiny spikes. He began to cry in pain.
“AHHHHHHHH” he screamed.
William woke up, his heart beating rapidly inside his chest. He was back in his bedroom. It took him a minute to process what has happened. He tried to calm himself down, then got out of bed. It was still dark outside, and he checked the clock. Barely even 11pm. Why would he have a nightmare about wearing a Springlock suit?
William was too tired for this. He walked into the kitchen and poured some more whiskey. 
“Not a lot left, I’ll have to get some more” he thought. William grabbed his keys and wallet and got in the car. 
“Damn, it’s one hell of a storm out here. I wonder if Mike’s window will hold up. Eh, serves him right for running away.”
William arrived at the liquor shop and bought some alcohol. He had developed an addiction since Garrett’s death, and it was really starting to affect his wallet.
“I should not be driving like this,” he said. “But I like risks.”
He drank some more and shifted up gears. He noticed the glowing sign on top of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria and muttered to himself.
“Stupid rip-off of Fredbear.. wait, who’s that?”
William pulled into the carpark of Freddy Fazbear’s and looked closer.
“Is that.. no, it can’t be!” William laughed. “There’s no way!”
William turned off the engine and got out the car. He walked over to the fire exit.
“Charlie?”
Charlie Emily stood outside the fire exit, banging on the door. Some bullies had thrown her out and locked her outside in the freezing rain. She turned around. A shadowy figure in a purple coat was standing behind her.
“D-do I know you?” she asked. She sounded as if she had been crying.
“Don’t you remember me, Charlie? Your old Uncle Willy!”
“Are you Daddy’s work friend?”
“Yup, that’s me!”
“Daddy said I’m not allowed to talk to you. He said you’re a very bad man.”
William reached into his pocket. “Is that so?”
“Yeah, I.. what’s that?”
Without thinking, William pulled out his pocketknife and slashed Charlie’s neck. All the colour drained from her face as she fell to her knees. Tears welled in her eyes as she made eye contact with her killer. 
Revenge had never felt so good to William. He looked around to check for cameras, of which there were none, and dragged Charlie by her feet over to the dumpsters. William ran back to the car, drank some more, and took off at speed out of the Freddy Fazbear’s car park. 
Charlie, unable to scream, lay numb on the floor behind the pizzeria. She was freezing in the rain, and utterly terrified. How could a family friend do such a thing?
In her final moments, she saw a familiar face. A lanky, black body with a white mask, buttons and striped limbs had crawled over to where Charlie lay. The Security Puppet had made it! But it was too late. There was no saving her now. In a final attempt to save Charlie, the Security Puppet curled into a ball and held Charlie’s corpse tightly.

“Charlie?” Henry was looking for her all over the pizzeria.
“Charlie! Come out now! The pizzeria’s closed!”
The sound of tires squealing in the car park made Henry jump. He ran to the window, but he didn’t see the car in time.
Henry turned around. Then he noticed something.
“The Security Puppet’s gone..” Henry said. “And the fire exit’s open!”
He ran over to the Prize Counter and searched. Then a dreadful thought crossed his mind. What if someone had kidnapped her?
Henry ran through the fire exit. He called for Charlie one last time.
“Charlie!” 
Henry looked at the ground. A track of footprints going around the back of the pizzeria. Henry followed them.
“Oh my.. oh my God! Charlie! Are you-” Henry looked closer. Charlie lay in a pool of blood, and the Security Puppet lay beside her.

“A soul for a soul.” William started to laugh maniacally. Not only did he get Henry back, but he just got away with murder, too!
William raced down the freeway. To him, rules meant nothing.
He was so intoxicated; he didn’t even notice he missed the turning. It took William a good couple of minutes to realise this, and he had to loop back round to go home. 
When William got back to his house, he fell asleep on the sofa. He was too tired to notice that he was lying on top of Ryan. Ryan managed to wriggle out and dragged William to bed.
At 11am the following morning, William woke up. He didn’t remember anything from the night before. He couldn’t remember the dream about the springlocks, nor could he remember drunk-driving and killing Charlie. Which is why he was shocked when he saw what was on the news.
“Breaking: Owner of famous pizzeria chain’s daughter was murdered last night. Local authorities left clueless.”
At that moment, Mike walked in.
“Wait, is that Charlie Emily? Who would want to kill her?”
“I don’t know, she-”
William had a flashback to the previous night. Approaching Charlie, grabbing the pocketknife, and slicing her neck-
“Ahem, she was such a nice girl,” William continued.
William tried to ignore the flashback. There’s no way he would do such a thing.
The phone rang. William walked over to it and answered it.
“Mr Afton speaking.”
Henry answered. “I know you did it.”
“Henry? And what did I do?”
“You know exactly what, William. Don’t play dumb with me.”
“Henry, I have no clue what you’re on about. What is it?”
“My daughter, William. You killed her!”
“Woah, you think I would do that-”
William had another flashback. This time, it was of Charlie talking to William outside the pizzeria.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“D-do I know you?” 
“Don’t you remember me, Charlie? Your old Uncle Willy!”
“Are you Daddy’s work friend?”
“Yup, that’s me!”
“Daddy said I’m not allowed to talk to you. He said you’re a very bad man.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“William, I know it was you.”
“Henry, I’d love to just sit here on the phone and argue with you, but I have to go now. Bye, old sport.”
William hung up the phone and sat back down with Ryan and Mike. The TV was still playing the news.
“..no witnesses or evidence.. there is suspicion but that’s all.. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person.. according to Mr Henry Emily.. ‘What happened to my daughter was a tragedy, but I can assure all you worried parents that your children are safe inside our pizzeria’..”
An advertisement for Freddy Fazbear’s played. William frowned as it played.
“Come on down to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, where fantasy and fun come to life, for kids and grown-ups alike! You don’t know what you’re missing!”
William couldn’t help but laugh. There was no way they said that right after a kid went missing at their pizzeria.
“What’s so funny?” Mike asked.
“A kid goes missing, and they put up an advert saying, “You don’t know what you’re missing!””
Ryan snorted. Mike looked confused.
“It’s rather ironic, because.. you don’t get it at all, do you?”
“I don’t see the humour in it.”
William sighed.
“Alright, then. Mike, you want to go shopping with me?”
“Where to?”
“I don’t know, any place that sells CCTV cameras?”
“Uh, ok?”
At the store, William and Mike were buying the cameras, when Mike recognised the cashier.
“Mr Miller?”
“Hey, Mike! Long time, no see!”
“You guys know each other?” William asked.
“Yeah, Mr Miller used to work at Fredbear’s.”
“Oh, ok.”
“It’s nice to see you too, Mr Afton.”
“Sorry, I forgot who you are. Remind me what job you worked?”
“Prize Counter.”
“Oh, are you Dave?”
“Yep. So, what are you wanting to buy?”
“Security Cameras. This little bugger smashed a window and ran away.”
“Oh, Mike! Why did you do that?”
“I wanted to go to Freddy Fazbear’s, but Dad wouldn’t let me.”
“Mr Afton, why isn’t he allowed at Freddy’s?”
“I’d rather not talk about it.”
“Alrighty then. Hey, where are the little ones? It’s been a while since I’ve-”
“They’re dead, OK?”
“Oh, that’s terrible! My apologies, Mr Afton.”
William and Mike were about to leave.
“Hope to see you two again soon!”
“Likewise.”
They left the store and got in the car. They drove home at the speed limit, and William had another flashback. 
Slicing her neck. Dragging her across the floor. Speeding away.
William groaned and put one hand over his face.
“Dad, are you ok?”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just tired is all.”
When they got home, William realised something important.
“Ryan, can you install these? I just remembered I have to be somewhere.”
“Sure, got nothing else to do.”
“Thanks”
William got back in the car and drove to where Fredbear’s used to be. A fancy-looking pizzeria stood there.
“What is this? How much money does Henry have?!”
Stood in Fredbear’s place was a large building about 5 times larger than Fredbear’s. Around it were posters of cartoonish characters that were colourful and shiny. Almost like a rip-off of Circus Baby’s Pizza World, but those characters were white, and these new Freddy’s characters were colourful and smooth and lacked face-plates.
 William looked disgusted. William started this. William invented the characters, and he had been robbed by his friend. 

Henry had only lost 1 kid.
William had lost 2.
Henry still had the company.
William was left with nothing.
That’s it! If William sabotaged Freddy’s, Henry would have nothing!
William remembered the dream he had the other night, of him in the strange pizzeria inside the Springbonnie suit. If Freddy’s was built over Fredbear’s, the old costumes should still be here.

10 minutes later, William returned to the pizzeria with the technician’s clothes that he had to wear at Fredbear’s. The nametag said Afton, so William scribbled it out and wrote Miller above it.
He grabbed his emergency toolbox from the boot of the car and walked to the front entrance. A security guard stood there.
“Mr Miller. I’ve been called to do repairs?”
The guard inspected him. He didn’t bother to check that any engineers were called in today, or if Dave Miller still worked here.
“Alright, you’re good to go. Parts and Service is that way.”
William entered the pizzeria. Step 1 of his plan worked!
As he walked through the pizzeria, he felt like he was being watched. He turned to see the blue bunny animatronic staring at him. 
“Jesus,” William said under his breath, “those things are creepy.”
William continued walking. He went down a hallway with a large metal door at the end. It said Parts and Service in large white letters. William went through it. 
Inside were metal skeletons, motors, eyes, and animatronic devices.
“They’ve changed it up a bit since I worked here” William said to himself.
He was right. The new animatronic parts were way more advanced than the ones William had to use at Fredbear’s. 
“Oh, what are these?”
William had noticed the Freddy and Friends characters. They looked uncanny in the dark. William turned around and looked for a light switch. 
“Damnit,” said William, “they can afford high-tech animatronics but not a bloody light switch?”
There were no lights in Parts and Service, except for the flashlight attached to the camera and a small torch on top of a toolbox. William grabbed the torch and turned it on. He took a closer look at the animatronic characters. They needed a little make-over. William pulled out his pocket-knife and got to work.
He started with Chica the chicken. He grabbed her head and ripped it off of her body. He pulled the beak apart, and the jaw came with it. He then ripped the eyes out and poorly re-attached the jaw and head together. He popped the eyes back in their sockets and stuck the head back on the body. But that wasn’t enough. He ripped Chica’s hands off and twisted her arms into a T shape. 
“Alright, Mr Ducky’s looking better.”
Next was Bonnie. William got his pocket-knife and sawed Bonnie’s face off. He ripped off Bonnie’s hands, left arm, and part of his shell. He didn’t like the way Bonnie’s eyes stuck out of his head without the mask, so William got rid of them, too. He started to laugh.
“Rip-off the rip-off, stupid blue bunny bastard!”
Hmm. Foxy was looking a bit strange. He needs a bit of fixing-up.
William noticed that Foxy was already looking quite withered, as there were large tears in his shell and his jaw looked loose. He also lacked a shell on his legs, exposing his endoskeleton.
“Makes my job easier” said William as he grabbed a crowbar from one of the shelves. He was about to swing the crowbar when Foxy began to talk.
“Yarrg!”
“Yarg? He can talk like a pirate?” William asked.
“I came for yer booty!”
William raised an eyebrow.
“..that be treasure, y’know.” Foxy continued.
“And they let this guy perform for kids?!” said William.
“Arg, arg, arg! Yo-ho-ho!” Foxy was laughing.
Foxy began to swing his hook. William jumped out of the way.
“Well then, ‘Yarg’ gonna get it!” William said as he swung the crowbar into the side of Foxy’s head, causing a chunk of his shell to break off. William then put the crowbar in Foxy’s mouth and hooked it around the inner jaw, pulling Foxy toward him. William reached behind Foxy’s head and flicked a switch, causing the animatronic to power down. 
William was breathing heavily. Breaking these animatronics was harder than he thought.
“Freddy. Oh, Freddy. What should I do to you, Freddy?”
William stabbed Freddy all over, leaving large holes that exposed his wiring. He then whacked Freddy with the crowbar, but Freddy was much more resilient than Foxy. 
William was hyperventilating now. He was exhausted.
“Maybe I should stop attacking these dumb robots and focus on what I came here for” said William.
He looked around the room. Fredbear and Springbonnie weren’t with the Freddy and Friends characters, but in another part of Parts and Service. As William walked over, he noticed something.
“Oh, I missed you guys so much! Hold on, what’s this?”
Behind the collapsed springlock suits was a door. William could tell that this door was used for deliveries. He tried to open it, and to his surprise, it was unlocked!
“This will come in handy later,” William said with a grin on his face.
He walked through the door and checked the other side. 
“No cameras, no witnesses.. all clear” he said to himself.
He went back through the door and wedged it so that he could get back in later. He stopped to check out the springlock suits.
“It’s been so long since I’ve last seen you guys!” William was talking to the springlock suits as if they were people. “My, they haven’t treated you well. Starting to look a bit rusty!” William was about to touch the suits, but then he remembered the springlocks were old and needed adjusting. If he wasn’t careful, he could trigger the springlocks and the loud sounds would alert people in the pizzeria.
“I’ll deal with it at home. I’m running out of time.”
William waved goodbye to the springlock animatronics, then gathered his things and left Parts and Service. Part 2 of the plan was complete!
William figured he might as well stay to look around.
As he walked into the main pizzeria, he had the feeling he was being watched. He tried not to make eye contact with the new animatronics onstage as they gave him the creeps. He looked around. Arcade machines, mini carousels, a ball pit, Freddy’s really had everything. Over in the corner stood a plastic, cartoonish boy holding a sign in one hand and a fake balloon in the other. On the sign was the word “Balloons!”. When William walked past it, it giggled and spoke to him. William stopped walking.
“Hello!”
“Oh, it speaks!”
“Hi!”
“What’s your name?”
“Hee-hee! Hello!”
William quickly realised it only said “Hello” and “Hi”. He continued walking around the pizzeria.
Soon, he was at the Prize Counter. At the Prize Counter was a large, shiny box with what looked like puppet strings above it. Also at the counter was a purple version of the balloon boy under the desk. This version didn’t do the childish laugh, but its eyes followed William around. A worker was standing there but paid no attention to him.
The shelves had been stocked with Freddy and Friends plushies, however there were 2 types. The original ones, and newer ones with buttons for eyes. The new ones were in the colours of the new, plastic animatronics too; being light brown, light blue, bright yellow and white with pink bits. Wait, what character was white and pink?
William was furious. He had been ripped-off one too many times.
He made his way from the Prize Counter to what he assumed was Pirate’s Cove, which was more of a play area than the other Pirate’s Coves at the other Freddy’s locations. He noticed a sign that said Kid’s Cove in large, colourful letters.
William paused. Shouldn’t there be an animatronic here? He noticed a child on the floor, playing with a large pile of metal bars.
“Hey kid, have you seen.. uh, Foxy?”
“You mean The Mangle? He’s right here!”
The kid pointed at the pile of metal bars on the ground. That’s when he noticed that it wasn’t a pile of bars, but a mangled animatronic.
“Woah, what happened to it?”
“Me and the other kids thought it was ugly, so we broke it.”
“Harsh..” said William under his breath.
“And at some point, they stopped fixing it. And now it’s The Mangle.”
“We’re going to have such terrible, wonderful fun!” said a female voice and a robotic voice.
A bunch of children ran into Kid’s Cove and messed around with The Mangle some more.
William slowly backed out of Kid’s Cove. The Mangle looked hurt, but William knew it didn’t feel pain.
He felt something touch his shoulder. He turned around.
“What the..”
“Hello, sir! Would you like to buy a slice of pizza and a drink for only $4.99?”
The plastic Bonnie animatronic was standing in front of William, offering him a meal deal.
“Uh, no thanks?”
“Thank you for your time, sir!”
“Holy shit” said William.
“H-hey! That’s not a nice thing to say! Please keep it family-friendly here at Freddy Fazbear’s!”
The plastic Freddy was telling him off. William was shocked.
“Sorry, I’m just.. how are you talking?”
The plastic Freddy put one hand next to his mouth and whispered, “We have an advanced AI so we can communicate with people. Makes the experience more memorable for the kids, y’know?”
“Funny joke. There’s got to be someone inside you or something.” William tried to look inside the plastic Freddy’s mouth. There was nothing inside, except for an endoskeleton with a voice box and lots of wires.
“How are you-”
“Like I said, advanced AI!”
“Damn, that’s actually impressive.”
“I could give you a leaflet which explains how I work and the things I can do, if you’d like.”
“Yeah, sure!”
William was very confused. This felt surreal. He was having a conversation with a 2-metre-tall plastic bear. He watched the bear walk away, stop to take a picture with some children, then continue walking to the Prize Counter where it was given a leaflet by the worker, circle back over to William, and hand him the leaflet.
“This is amazing; you’re amazing!”
“Thank you, sir!”
“I have to go soon, but I might come back soon. I’m actually starting to like it here.”
“Sure! We love returning customers here at Freddy’s!”

William read the leaflet. His ‘conversation’ with Freddy had left him intrigued. 
In the leaflet was a cross-section of plastic Bonnie with a description of everything about the characters. 

THE MAGIC OF FAZBEAR’S
Here at Freddy Fazbear’s, we try our very best to bring fantasy and fun to life, for kids and grown-ups alike! Our engineers have worked very hard to design a state-of-the-art Endoskeleton1, each equipped with a custom Artificial Intelligence chip2 that is capable of having articulated conversations with guests. 
The characters each have their own personalities, and also can remember faces3. They understand emotions, too, so if you’re feeling down, they’ll figure out how to cheer you up! The list includes, but is not limited to:
•	Jokes
•	Games
•	Piggy-back rides (upper weight limit of 25 Kg)
•	Free drink (see menu for list)
The characters can freely roam around the pizzeria4 and will happily take a photo with you during your time here at Freddy’s. The characters have 15 poses and 10 facial expressions that you can choose from, just by asking.
When the scheduled performances aren’t running, the characters will take song requests. This can be done by using the control panel next to the stage, or by asking the characters. You may have to be patient though, as song requests are popular, and the queue won’t be short! 
Now, you may be wondering if Freddy Fazbear’s is a safe place for your kid to run free and play all day in. We can assure you that the characters have been designed to protect your children at all times, even going as far as linking the facial recognition system to the local police system. Yes, you heard that right. Our animatronics are able to recognise potential threats and will deal with them as quickly and safely as possible5.

5.	FSS (File Sharing System)	



Glossary
1. A metal robot “skeleton” inside the Animatronics that is responsible for movement.
2. A special chip that can be inserted into a port on the Endoskeleton that takes over and gives it the correct personality.
3. The Facial Recognition sensor scans your face and saves it to a system. If your face is already on the list, it will remember details about you. If your face is on the criminal list, you may be asked to leave or be escorted out by an animatronic.
4. The characters have a map of the pizzeria saved to their Chips. This does not include Parts and Service or the kitchen. And don’t worry; the animatronics will not enter the toilets unless absolutely necessary.
5. If a criminal was detected in the pizzeria, the animatronics would perform the JUMPSCARE Protocol.
J = Jog                                    [image: toy Freddy JUMPSCARE protocol]
M = Memory
P = Perform
S = Scan
C = Capture
A = Arrest
R = Return
To understand this better, here’s an explanation. The animatronics ‘jog’ their memory, then perform a scan to determine if the target is a criminal. If so, the animatronics will attempt to capture the target and arrest them until there is a confirmation on what to do. Once the target has been dealt with, the animatronics shall return to their normal performances. 
Thanks for reading this leaflet, and for visiting Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza! We hope to see you again soon!

William was genuinely impressed with Henry’s work here. This was on another level. He stuffed the leaflet in his pocket and continued looking around.

William noticed a crowd of children all surrounded around one specific area. He wondered what could possibly gain that much attention. Had a kid fallen over? Had someone beat the record on a game?
No. They were surrounding another plastic animatronic. This one was yellow and had a large, pink, plastic cupcake in its hand. It appeared to be doing tricks with the cupcake, which was moving somehow. William hadn’t actually noticed this character. But now he was starting to realise why it was so popular.
This version of Chica the Chicken was unlike any other version. Instead of being, well, chubby, this one was very in shape. She wore a bikini and had a very feminine shape. At first, William wondered why they would design a character like this in a kid’s place, but then William got distracted.
“Dayum,” he said.
Chica heard him. She winked. 
William walked away. He might come back to her later. But for now, he had seen pretty much everything and was ready to leave. William was about to leave when he heard a music box play.
William recognised the tune. 
“Grandfather’s Clock” he said. 
That was the tune that played when the Security Puppet was outside of its box at Fredbear’s. The Security Puppet was Henry’s idea, so William paid no attention to it. But then William remembered something.
On the news about Charlie’s death, the Security Puppet was seen hugging her dead body.
“Oh no..” said William. He hoped that the Security Puppet didn’t recognise him. He looked away quickly, then checked to see if the Puppet was still in the box.
“Oh, shit!” The Security Puppet was out, and William accidentally made eye contact. Its eyes began to glow white, and it looked at the other animatronics. They seemed to be controlled by The Puppet, and their eyes turned black.
“..the Jumpscare protocol..” William said under his breath. He had to leave. Now.
The animatronics advanced toward him, and he ran for the exit. The music box stopped, then started playing Pop Goes the Weasel on loop. 
William knew he was in danger. The animatronics definitely had a more violent approach to “capture and arrest” than was said on the leaflet. He got to the door rushed out of it.
“Sir, is everything ok?” The security guard was still stood outside the door.
“Uh, yes! All good to go!” William said in his Dave Miller impression. He walked quickly back to the car and drove away in a hurry.
“Weird,” said the guard.
William was out of breath. He had a feeling that part 3 of the plan would be much harder than anticipated. 
William had waited all day. He had been reading the leaflet all day to understand how the plastic animatronics worked. He decided to scribble his plan and notes down on a piece of paper.

After about half an hour, he managed to formulate a plan, backup plan, and any tips he’ll need.
“That should do” he said.


Plan:
1.	Use disguise to sneak in. 
2.	Enter P+S.
3.	Find Springbonnie + Fredbear.
4.	Find second exit.
5.	Prepare to break in later.
6.	Break in.
7.	Steal Springbonnie + Fredbear.
Backup:
1.	Wear Old Springbonnie fursuit.
2.	Bring knife.
3.	Cause a power outage to distract everyone.
Notes:
Facial Recog doesn’t recognise animal masks.
Puppet knows who you are. If in trouble, keep her asleep using the music.
Take a picture of Chica.
Need a trailer to carry Springbonnie and Fredbear.

William was content with his list, and it was getting dark outside. Freddy’s might be closing soon. William gathered the things he needed for part 3, including the Dave Miller disguise, the toolbox, the Springlock Calibration kit, the camera, a kitchen knife, and a Fredbear mask he found in Mike’s room. He checked the time. 7:37. He put the gear into a bag, them put the bag into the car. He opened the garage door and coupled the trailer to the back of the car. He then parked the car further down the street so that Mike and Ryan didn’t notice. 
He went back inside. The whiskey bottle was calling his name, but he tried to ignore it. He had to do this sober.
It was 8:41. The sky was almost pitch-black. William felt that now was still too early. 
“I made some food,” said Ryan. He handed William a plate. On the plate was a steak and some chips.
“Thanks, mate.”
Ryan gave William a fork and steak knife. 
William sliced open the steak. “Nice! Medium-rare, the best way to cook a steak” thought William.

It was 11:18. William had finished his food and was watching a show on the TV. Ryan and Mike were both asleep. William was wondering if now was a good time to leave. William started thinking.
“If I drive slowly, I should get there by half past. I have to drive slowly anyways because of the trailer. The journey back will be even longer because of the added weight of the suits. If all is well, I should be out by 12, but if the animatronics are active, then I’m not sure what could happen.”
William got out of his seat. He had made his final decision. He quietly left the house, locked the door behind him, and walked down the street to the car. His plan was in motion.
After 15 minutes of careful driving, William got to the pizzeria. He took his bag out of the car and made his way to the back of the pizzeria. The door was still wedged, so William opened it and snuck in. He knew that there was a security camera around the corner and there was probably also a night-guard in the building, so he had to be extremely careful to stay in the blind spots and make as little noise as possible. He slipped on the plastic Fredbear mask and peeked around the corner. The camera appeared to be off. He looked around. The animatronics were still there, in the extremely damaged condition that he left them in. 
William remembered something. The night-guard’s shift would start at 12am, meaning that he would arrive at 11:45, therefore William would have to do everything by then. William got to work.
First, he had to put the springlock suits into Animatronic mode, to avoid it snapping later. He grabbed his Springlock Calibration kit and pulled out a weird tool. He stuck it into Springbonnie’s neck and twisted it. Suddenly, Springbonnie started to shake as something clicked. Then there was the sound of grinding metal, and the sound of sword fighting. William flinched as Springbonnie’s springlocks snapped and the inner exoskeleton collapsed, forming the same endoskeleton as the now-withered animatronics.
Now that Springbonnie was in Animatronic mode, the next step was much safer. William reached inside Springbonnie’s body and tried to locate the cable that connected the animatronic’s code to the endoskeleton. He unplugged it. Now there was no chance of Springbonnie bursting into Performance Mode during the heist.
William picked up Springbonnie (he was really struggling as the suit was heavy) and dragged it towards the door. He wedged the door and continued to drag Springbonnie to the trailer. Once he had done that, he threw a blanket over it and tied it down. He went back into the pizzeria. 
SLAM! The door shut behind him.
“Oh no, no, no, no, no!” said William. He tried to re-open the door, but it was stuck.
“Shit,” he said. “How do I get out now?”
William froze. He heard the front door of the pizzeria open.
“Hello? H-Hello?” said a male voice.
The night-guard had arrived for his shift. William wouldn’t be able to get out now. William sat in the corner of Parts and Service and cried inside. He might just be stuck here all night.
The night-guard started whistling the March of the Toreadors, which is the theme that played in every Freddy’s advertisement.
William had a thought. What if he distracted the night-guard by  turning on the withered animatronics?
William got up and turned on all the animatronics. He then pushed open the Parts and Service door and went back to his hiding spot next to Fredbear. He heard one of the animatronics come to life and make their way out of the room. 
“Woah, something ain’t right,” said the night-guard. “They shouldn’t be moving-”
William peeked around. Foxy had left. He was standing at the end of the corridor with his jaw wide and his head at an angle. The night-guard continued to complain.
“Uh, why’s the weird fox there? What do I do? WHY IS HE STARING AT ME LIKE THAT?” the night-guard cried.
Foxy took another few steps down the hallway. Some sort of alarm had gone off.
“Hold on, I remember that Phone guy talking about it! Uh, do I flash the light or wear the spare Freddy mask?”
Foxy continued down the hallway.
“Oh crap!”
William was half amused, half worried. It sounded like the JUMPSCARE protocol didn’t work properly in the old animatronics.

Metallic footsteps echoed through the building. Suddenly, there was a loud, robotic sound and the night-guard screamed. There was a loud thud, then there was the sound of flesh being torn, then the crunch of bones. William’s guess? Foxy had taken out the night-guard. William grabbed his bag, snuck out of Parts and Service and looked down the corridor. There was blood on the wall in the office where the night-guard’s body sat limp. Foxy was standing over him. William ran away into the main area of the pizzeria.
“H-hey, you’re not allowed here after dark!” 
William turned. The plastic bear was talking to him from the stage. 
“Hold on, I recognise you! You’re the engineer that asked me about how I worked. Right?”
“Uh, yeah” said William in his Dave Miller voice.
“Don’t let me catch you breaking the rules again, or you’ll be banned!”
“Alright, sorry.” William rolled his eyes and turned toward the exit.
“Well, well, what do we have here?”
William recognised that voice. It was Charlie’s.
“Charlie?” William immediately dropped the Dave Miller voice and went back to his original one.
“So you do remember.” The Security Puppet was speaking in Charlie’s voice.
“I’m sorry, do you guys know each other?” said Freddy.
“He’s the man that betrayed me. Murdered me at this very spot not long ago.”
“Oh, did he now?” said Freddy.
“No wait, hold on, how are you speaking like that? How are you, you?” said William.
“I’ve possessed this body somehow. It’s kept me, my soul, alive.”
Freddy grabbed William. “You know we don’t allow criminals here at Freddy’s, so you’re going to be held here until the police arrive.”
“Oh yeah? How do you expect them to believe a robot and a ghost?” William reached into his pocket.
“Because Mr Emily can vouch for us” said The Puppet.
“Yeah, well..” William pulled out the Fredbear mask and put it on. “Try and catch this!”
Freddy started looking around frantically, as if William had disappeared. He let go of William, and William made a run for it.
“Freddy, how could you! He’s escaping!” the Puppet yelled.
“It’s like he just.. disappeared!” Freddy said.

William burst through the front door and ran back to his car. He had many factors on his side. 

First, the police wouldn’t arrive for a while. 
Second, the animatronics were programmed so that they couldn’t leave. 
Third, that the police would be distracted by the dead night-guard. Fourth, that Foxy was loose and showed no mercy. 
Fifth, that William was only carrying Springbonnie, so driving home would be quicker.

Except that none of these were the case. 
The police station was nearby, and Freddy’s had somewhat of a priority, meaning that the police responded quicker. 
The Puppet could leave the building, but it couldn’t travel far without the puppet strings as it had a weak endoskeleton. Also, The Puppet wasn’t waterproof, and because of this, it didn’t risk going outside. It already was damaged from when it tried to save Charlie. 
The night-guard’s body was in the office, which is about the furthest point from where the police were called. Also, the police would just call a paramedic and continue their search for the criminal. 
The alarms were raised inside Freddy’s, and because of this, red lights were flashing. Foxy is disoriented by flashing lights, which causes him to reboot and return to Parts and Service.
Springbonnie was still heavy, and William’s car was made for speed, not strength. As William drove away, the car made it more obvious that it was taking more than it could handle.
Once William had gotten home, his car was groaning, and all the warning lights had started to flash. He would need to get that checked out. William had parked his car in the driveway and opened the garage door. He took the trailer and Springbonnie inside and shut the garage door. He’d deal with Springbonnie tomorrow. 
William locked the door that connected the garage to the rest of the house. No-one needed to see what was in there.

The following morning, William put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the garage door. He needed to do modifications and tests on Springbonnie’s exoskeleton. He removed the shell, reducing Springbonnie to just a pile of furry pieces and a scary-looking metal suit that had many sharp parts and wires on it.

William had to test the reliability of the springlocks themselves.
He knew 4 ways to test it.
Test 1. Tap test.
William grabbed a screwdriver and tapped certain places around the springlock suit. He made note of which places would trigger a springlock failure when tapped.
Test 2. Shake test.
William grabbed the suit by the shoulders and shook it violently. He made note of how much shakiness the suit could take before it triggered a springlock failure.
Test 3. Water test.
William got a glass of water and a pipette. He then put a drop of water on the springlocks to see if it caused a springlock failure. He made note of this, too.
Test 4. Pressure test.
William got a polystyrene mannequin and put it inside the springlock suit. He pushed parts of the mannequin against the frame to see if the springlocks were sensitive to touch. He made note of it. Then, he removed the mannequin and just pushed on the springlocks with a screwdriver. He broke the screwdriver doing this, then made note of it.

The springlocks were in terrible condition. William would need to recoil all of the springlocks before he wore it again.
7 hours later, William had repaired the Springbonnie suit. He put the shell back on the exoskeleton, and left the garage, locking it behind him. He had missed lunch and was hungry.
“Hey, Ryan! Mike! You guys fancy a burger?” he yelled.
“Sure!” they both replied.
As they drove into town to find a place to eat, they passed Freddy’s. There was a cop car outside and the sign said “Closed.”
“I wonder what’s happened this time,” said William. He smirked.

They had arrived at a diner. The three of them walked in, where they were greeted by a man in his twenties with a name-tag on his chest. On it were the words “Hi, I’m Matt.” 
Matt started to speak. “Hello everyone, welcome to-”
“Can we just get the menus? I’m starving,” said William.
“Ok then, I’ll be right back.” He turned around, grabbed three menus, and spun around again.
“Here ya go!”
The three of them each grabbed a menu. Matt walked them over to their table.
“Table B87. Let me know if you need anything!” Matt said. 
“Yeah,  yeah, whatever” William replied. 
They all ordered drinks and a burger (William chose a cheeseburger, Ryan chose a chicken burger and William made Mike get a kid’s meal) and ate their food quietly. 
“Uh, William?” asked Ryan. 
“What?”
“What’ve you been working on in the garage? It’s really noisy.” 
Mike began to speak. “Yeah, it sounds like the-”
“Springlock suits,” William and Mike said in unison.
“Those old costumes from Fredbear’s?” asked Ryan. “Where did you get those from?”
William stuttered. “Uh, t-the.. uh, Fredbear’s, obviously!”
“But I thought you shut them all down a while ago?”
“Yeah, but-”
“I swear Henry took them to Freddy’s” Mike interrupted.
William leaned forward, lowered his voice and began to whisper. 
“Alright, I did a little.. repossession. Don’t freak out; the suits were technically mine anyways. Plus, it’s only Springbonnie. I left Fredbear behind.”
“You stole them?”
“Not ‘stole,’ just taking what’s rightfully mine.”
“And also Henry’s-”
“It was my technology! My creations, not his! I left him the Fredbear one because he helped make that character, but apart from that, it’s mine!” William was getting a bit too loud.
“Woah, ok!” said Ryan. “Let’s try to keep a bit quieter.. anyways, what even happened between you and Henry? None of this makes sense, you two were best friends before.”
William sighed. “He fired me after the deaths of Garrett and Elizabeth. Says that I was a bad father and a bad engineer.”
“Oh my” said Ryan.
“But Garrett was my fault. I’m the one that.. that put his head in the jaw of Fredbear-”
“Which was way too strong for an animatronic. The springlock frame was pretty heavy, so we had to use hydraulics to control the jaw. Henry said that my choice of upgrades was the reason he died.” William looked angry. He clenched his fist tightly.
Ryan looked horrified. “William, it’s not your fault. It was a freak accident, and whatever Henry said probably wasn’t true-”
“BUT DON’T YOU SEE? IT WAS MY FAULT!” William yelled.
Everyone at the diner turned to face William, who was purple with anger. Ryan and Mike shared the same embarrassed look on their faces.
Matt walked over. “Is everything alright?” He was smiling, but not confidently like before.
“Does it look like everything is fucking alright?!”
“Sir, we can’t tolerate bad language here at-”
“Alright, I guess I’ll just go fuck myself then!” William stormed out of his seat and rushed back to the car.
Matt watched William run outside, raised his eyebrows and turned to face Ryan and Mike.
“I’m so sorry, I don’t know what’s gotten into him today.”
“Uh, do you guys want the bill?” Matt’s smile had faded.
“Uh,” Ryan looked at Mike, who was still confused about what had happened. “I think so?”
Matt left, only to return with a tray with a receipt and two mints on it. Ryan paid the bill and gave Matt a $20 tip. Matt’s smile returned, and he thanked Ryan.
“Thank you, and we hope to see you again soon!”
“Likewise,” said Ryan. Both Ryan and Mike had a strong feeling that William would not be bringing them back here again.

In the car, William was having a mental breakdown. Images of nightmarish robots and dead children flashed in his eyes. He groaned and started pulling on his hair. 
William felt sick. He jumped out of the car and ran to a nearby bush, regurgitating the burger he had just ate. The smell of vomit only made William feel worse. He curled up into a ball on the pavement and cried.
Ryan and Mike exited the diner and rushed over to William. 
“Dad?” said Mike.
“Come on, buddy! You good?” asked Ryan.
“Ung.. go away!” William said in a strained voice. 
“We can’t, you’ve got the keys – do you need anything? Water, a snack, a trip to the hospital?”
William reached into his pocket and pulled out the keys. “Whiskey. There’s a bottle in the glove box.”
“Alright, but I’m driving,” said Ryan. They went to the car. William got to his feet and followed painfully.

Later that day, William had recovered and was ready for his new plan. Now that Springbonnie was all fixed up, William was going to take it back to Freddy’s. His old disguise would no longer work, so he would wear the Springbonnie costume once he got inside. He gathered the things he would need, including a knife, his toolkit, the Springlock Calibration Kit just in case anything went wrong, and lastly, his whiskey bottle, and put them all in the car. He then dragged Springbonnie back onto the trailer and pulled the blanket over it. However, while doing this, his hand slipped, and he accidentally punched himself in the face.
“Ow! Why I ought to-” William stopped, took a breath, calmed himself down, and began to laugh. He continued to laugh as he walked around the car and climbed in the car. 
William arrived at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. As he pulled into the parking lot, he felt a thump and heard a squeal. He looked in the mirror and saw that dog Mike “saved” that one time. ‘Oh whatever, it’s just a stupid dog’, he thought. It wasn’t going to stop him from going into the pizzeria. He parked the car in the alleyway behind the pizzeria and walked around to the front of the pizzeria. He had his Dave Miller costume, but he knew the animatronics would still recognise him. Even if he wore the Fredbear mask, the Security Puppet would recognise him.
William was frustrated. He went back to the Parts And Service exit door and looked around. That’s when he noticed…
“The vents!” William noticed a ventilation shaft on the roof above the kitchen. He looked around and tried to find something to climb on.
William climbed onto the dumpster, then put one foot on the wall and one foot on the water pipe and climbed up. He then pulled himself up onto the roof and crawled over to the vent. He climbed inside it and slid through it.
Below him were the sounds of workers making the crappy pizza with way too much basil on it. William continued crawling.
There was a hole on the bottom of the vent. William looked through it and saw the main stage. Freddy was singing a song and Bonnie was playing the guitar, but Chica wasn’t on stage. William continued crawling. 
William turned a corner and stopped. The vent went down suddenly, and William knew that it was a very high drop that could kill him. He shuffled closer and took a peek, then pulled a tiny screw out of his toolbox and dropped it. It hit the ground after a second, so William knew the drop was at least 8 metres.

After a minute, William realised that he could just press his shoes and back on either side and slowly shuffle down. He managed to get down with only a few scratches on his back, and continued crawling. He had noticed a few vent openings around the pizzeria the other day, and the closest one to Parts And Service was the vent in the party room, but that still wasn’t close enough to get to Parts and Service without being spotted. 
He made it to the party room and froze. He saw a bright blue plastic foot at the opening of the vent and instantly recognised it as Bonnie’s. He backed up and stayed silent. He would have to wait until the animatronic had left the room.
After waiting for what felt like half an hour, William sighed as the plastic Bonnie left the party room and the metallic clunking of his feet sounded further away. William climbed out of the vent and swiftly snuck out of the room, then ran to the end of the hallway and peeked around the corner. Freddy and Chica were on stage and Bonnie was next to the arcade machines. William sighed and was about to move when he felt a child tap on his side.
“Uh, ‘scuse me sir, but what are you doing?” the child asked.
“What? Oh, nothing! I’m just one of the engineers!”
“Oh, do you work here?”
“Yeah, I’m just.. uh.. afraid of them characters!”
“Haha, you’re so silly! Even I’m not afraid of them!” the child said proudly.
“Ha, yeah.. right.” William dropped the cheerful tone and looked back down the corridor. He turned to the kid and said “Alright, you run along now! I heard them robots catch you when no-one’s looking, then kill you and hide you where nobody will ever find you!” William gave the kid a menacing grin and walked away, whistling. The kid whimpered.
William entered Parts and Service. The withered animatronics had been moved by someone, but Fredbear sat where he was before in the same crumpled position; with his knees tucked to his shoulders and his arms limp, and his jaw hanging loosely with the Performer eyes staring blankly at William. William was glad to see this, as it meant that nobody would have noticed that Springbonnie was missing. However, it definitely meant that the withering of the animatronics had been reported. William took a closer look at the withered animatronics to see if there were any ways to get inside the animatronic shells. 
William could tell by how much Freddy looked like Fredbear that Henry reused the design, and safely assumed that Freddy’s chest could be opened by pulling on his bow-tie and shut by pressing his nose.
Chica could be opened up by lifting her bib, which was simple enough. Bonnie, like Springbonnie, could be opened up by twisting his top button, and Foxy couldn’t be opened up, but he had a large enough cavity in his torso for William to commit his plan. 
William exited Parts and Service through the delivery door and wedged it behind him, then brought the Springbonnie suit in and made it stand up in the corner of the room, detaching each limb from the torso. He then coiled the springlocks and shuffled his legs into the lower half of the suit. He unbuttoned the back of the torso and bent it open, putting it on like a big jacket and buttoning it up again, then putting the arms on and clicking them into the joints. Then he put the hands on, which were nothing more than metal gloves painted gold, and grabbed the mask and wedged it on his head. For some strange reason, putting the full suit on made William feel a sense of power, as if he were a god. He then grabbed his kitchen knife and slid it down the left leg of the suit, between the exoskeleton and the furry shell of the animatronic so that it wouldn’t reduce his mobility or trigger the springlocks. Springbonnie was ready for his performance.
Well, not quite..
Springbonnie wasn’t quite the part yet as William hadn’t reattached the cables yet, so William twisted the top button and Springbonnie’s chest popped open to reveal a bunch of cables, a metal frame, and 6 large metallic claws wrapped around William’s chest. They were rather frightening to look at, but William didn’t care. He knew they were the most stable springlocks anyone could ever make and trusted that they wouldn’t fail. 
William had done the process of rewiring the suit whilst inside it so many times that he could do it with his eyes closed. He grabbed the cables, felt around for the CPU and plugged in the cables responsible for the voice changer, eyes and ears, and pressed a button that resets the system. He left the other cables unplugged as they were for independent movement and stuff that the suit only needed in Animatronic Mode. He wouldn’t need them now. He closed up Springbonnie’s chest and twisted the button in the opposite direction.
Springbonnie made his way out of Parts and Service and made his way into the main area of the pizzeria. The children didn’t pay much attention, the parents shrugged it off, and the 3 employees in the main area assumed it was some scheduled thing for someone’s birthday. Clearly, Henry had been focusing their budget on the animatronics. Springbonnie walked over to the balloon boy and took 5 balloons. The balloon boy didn’t laugh, and he assumed that it only laughed around humans. Springbonnie then looked around to find his first target. 
Wait! There was the girl Mike was talking to! The one with the dog! Springbonnie walked up to the girl. As he got closer, he noticed the girl was leaning over the Fruity Maze game, crying about something. 



Susie sniffed. Her parents had given her the terrible news that someone had killed her beloved pet dog Max on her birthday. She didn’t think this day could get any worse. She stared into the screen on the Fruity Maze machine, her eyes filled with tears, when she saw a yellow rabbit staring back at her in the reflection. She rubbed her eyes and looked again. Sure enough, it was still there.
“What’s wrong, little girl?” asked the Yellow Rabbit.
“M-my dog Max is dead! On my b-birthday!” Susie replied.
The Yellow Rabbit went silent.
“He’s not really dead...”
“What?”
“He’s not really dead…”
“But my parents said so..”
“I can show you…”
“You can?”
“Yes. Follow me…”
Susie, feeling a glimpse of hope, held the Yellow Rabbit’s hand and followed it. It looked at her and smiled with its eyes. The Yellow Rabbit opened a large door, and she walked inside. It was really dark until the Yellow Rabbit turned on the light, revealing a small plastic table with three slices of pizza and one small cake with a candle and frosting that read ‘Happy Birthday SUSIE’. Susie was confused for multiple reasons. Max wasn’t here, the Yellow Rabbit somehow knew her name, and it had just locked the door behind her and scratched the back of its leg. She began  to feel a sense of dread as it stared at her.
“Wh-what are you doing? Where’s Max? Why is there a c-cake here?”
“because it’s your Happy Day…” whispered the Yellow Rabbit. It put one finger over its mouth and revealed a knife. 
Susie’s face went pale. But before she could scream for help, the Yellow Rabbit grabbed her and sliced her neck. The Yellow Rabbit then walked over to the withered Chica animatronic and lifted her bib, then scooped up Susie and squeezed her into the animatronic. She made a rasping sound as the air was forced out of her lungs.
Springbonnie had claimed its first victim.
He left Parts and Service and went in search of more children. With 4 balloons, he returned to the main area. Maybe he should collect a small group of kids; that way he’d take less time. 
Fritz, Gabriel, Jeremy and Cassidy were close friends that had come to Freddy Fazbear’s for Susie’s birthday. They thought it was odd that they saw Susie crying and suddenly disappear but didn’t think too much of it. Maybe she went home? The children continued eating their pizza and drinking their Fizzy-Faz as a yellow rabbit person walked up to them.
“Hey, kids! Are you friends of Susie?” asked the Yellow Rabbit.
“Yeah, what’s happened to her? Did she go home?” asked Jeremy.
“She’s in Party Room 5, waiting for you guys! Want to come join her?”
The children all looked at each other and agreed.
“Yes please!”
“Great. Follow me…” the Yellow Rabbit said. The children got out of their seats and followed the Yellow Rabbit to the back room. None of them even considered for a moment that there was never a 5th party room, or that the door it opened had the words “Parts and Service” on it.
The Yellow Rabbit slammed the door behind them and locked it. It then pulled a knife out from behind it and grabbed the child closest to him. 
Jeremy screamed as the Yellow Rabbit stabbed him through the heart. As the Yellow Rabbit twisted the blade, Jeremy felt an excruciating pain and cried, shortly before passing out and dying from the blood loss. The other children watched in pure horror as Jeremy fell to the ground, soaked in dark red blood. They all screamed, but nobody could hear them. They were trapped in a room with a killer rabbit.
Gabriel tried hiding behind the corner as the Yellow Rabbit stuffed Jeremy’s dead body into the broken Bonnie animatronic. He peeked around the corner and made eye contact with the Yellow Rabbit. With tears in his eyes and his throat clogged with mucus, he curled up into a ball next to the Fredbear costume and kept his eyes closed, hoping that maybe it was all just a nightmare. 
The Yellow Rabbit grabbed Gabriel’s hair and dragged him into the centre of the Parts And Service room. As it held the knife high above its head and swung, Gabriel rolled out of the way. The knife barely missed him, but it left a large gash on the side of his face. He put one hand over it, then moved his hand away and looked at it. So much blood! The Yellow Rabbit then slashed Gabriel’s neck, almost decapitating him, and Gabriel felt himself drowning in his own blood. The Yellow Rabbit then picked Gabriel up and tried to stuff him in Freddy’s chest, but Gabriel held his hand out and grabbed Freddy’s face and jaw, trying to resist. The blood-stained hands left a smudge of darkness over Freddy’s left eye. Gabriel tried to resist, but the blood loss from his neck made him go limp and he lost consciousness.
Fritz, despite being the smallest, was known for being the fastest runner in the friend group, and he bolted to the door. He rattled the handle, desperate to unlock it, but it wouldn’t budge. He banged on the door and yelled, but the Yellow Rabbit advanced toward him and stuck the knife right through Fritz’s back. It then dragged the blade down diagonally in a similar way to how Withered Foxy’s chest looked, and Fritz’s lungs collapsed as the blade punctured his lungs. The Yellow Rabbit then dragged Fritz’s body over to Withered Foxy and stuffed his small body into the small cavity in Foxy’s torso.
“AAAAAAAAAAH!” William heard a child yell and turned around in the suit to see the last child, Cassidy, wielding a crowbar and running at him. Before he could react, the little girl smacked the crowbar into Springbonnie’s waist, causing a springlock to snap on his side. He yelled, and the voice changer glitched, making him sound like a wounded animal. He dropped the knife, then stomped towards Cassidy. He grabbed her by the neck and slammed her into the wall, then threw her at the ground. He punched her, then punched her again, then grabbed her by the legs and swung her towards the wall. Somehow, she still had the energy to fight back, and grabbed the crowbar and smashed it at Springbonnie’s suit until small parts of the shell began to break off. Now Springbonnie was starting to look like the withered animatronics. She swung with all of her strength and whacked Springbonnie’s head, causing William to stumble and crash into the wall. Another springlock snapped and pierced his shoulder, but it wouldn’t cause a failure. William yelled again, making the distorted, wounded animal sound he had made earlier, and then took off the mask. He wanted Cassidy to see his face before he killed her.
“Mr Afton! Y-you horrible, twisted man!”
“Hahahah! I’ve heard that before!” William said, smacking Cassidy with the back of Springbonnie’s hand. She wasn’t crying, but she was angry. Heck, she looked almost as insane as William was! 
“I’ll be here and always watching,” she said. “The one you should not have killed.”
William laughed. He then put the mask back on, then uppercut Cassidy in the jaw, completely shattering it. Then he threw her on the ground and kicked her in the head several times.
Cassidy had one last idea in mind. She saw William’s knife on the ground and grabbed it. She giggled in a way that creeped even William out, then held the knife and sliced her own neck. William froze. He hadn’t expected that. He sat for a minute, recoiled the springlocks, then grabbed Cassidy’s dead body and stared. Her jaw was completely shattered, half of her face had swollen, and her neck had been painted black with her own blood. William looked around and saw the Fredbear costume. Its eyes had seemingly disappeared, the sockets filled with a black void. William couldn’t really care about that though and opened up the suit to place Cassidy’s body inside. 
As he shut the suit up, he looked up at Fredbear’s face. Blood dripped from the mouth and eyes, and the black void in his eyes now had small, bright white pupils that focused on William. 
“The one you should not have killed,” whispered two voices at once. One was Cassidy, and the other was…
“GARETT?” William yelled. He had heard the voices of two dead children, one of them being his son, whispering to him from inside a robot suit. Even worse, the eyes now glowed white.
William panicked, then grabbed his stuff and ran out the exit door, still wearing the suit. He slammed the door behind him, got in the car and drove away as quick as possible. Still wearing the suit. He adjusted his seat so that he could see better, instead of taking off the damn suit.

William arrived home, out of breath and still wearing the suit. He got into the garage and locked himself inside before Ryan or Mike noticed.
William removed the suit from his body, starting with the head, then the hands, arms, torso and lastly the legs. He scrubbed away the blood and looked at the damage to the suit. The entire left side was intact, but the right side had holes that exposed the exoskeleton inside. 
“Goddammit!” William was annoyed. That little brat nearly killed him, and worse, nearly destroyed the suit. He was so glad that the child was dead now. Serves her right. 
William stared at the suit. How was he supposed to repair it? He couldn’t just put duct-tape on it, but he couldn’t just walk into the pizzeria with holes in the suit. He sighed. Looked like he had another problem on his hands.

Jeremy clocked in for his shift. He was new in town and needed a job, when suddenly Freddy’s had a new job available. The pay wasn’t great, and the hours were worse, but at least he was making money.
As he unlocked the front door with the key he had been given, he instantly got a chill down his spine. He looked around. No-one was in the parking lot, and the building wasn’t cold – it was pretty warm actually. He shrugged it off and pulled out the scrunched-up piece of paper from his pocket. 
“These buildings are so much more complicated than I remember,” Jeremy said to himself. After locking the door behind him, he made his way to the office and looked around. There were a bunch of small TVs, posters and kids’ drawings everywhere, with a particularly large poster stuck to the wall right behind the spinning chair at the desk. Jeremy decided that it wasn’t worth worrying about and sat in his chair. He spun around a little, then pulled the piece of paper and flipped it around to the other side. It had some basic instructions on it.
1.	Enter building and lock up behind you.
2.	Enter office.
3.	Grab flashlight provided and put fresh batteries in.
4.	Play voicemail on phone.
5.	Follow instructions that Phone Guy tells you.
Jeremy opened the draw in the desk and found an old, chunky flashlight and a box of batteries. He put a couple of batteries in the flashlight and pressed the button. He aimed the flashlight down the hallway, and somehow the flashlight managed to illuminate the hallway almost all the way to the toilets. He put the flashlight back on the desk and pressed a button on the telephone. 
A familiar voice began speaking. It was the manager.
“Uh, hello? Hello, hello? Uh, hello and welcome to your new summer job at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Uh, I'm here to talk you through some of the things you can expect to see during your first week here, and to help you get started down this new and exciting career path.”
Jeremy smiled faintly. It definitely wasn’t summer, but at least hearing a familiar voice would keep him from total boredom.
“Uh, now I want you to forget anything you may have heard... ..about the old location, you know. Uh, some people still have a somewhat... negative impression of the company. Uh... that old restaurant was kind of left to rot for quite a while, but I-I want to reassure you, Fazbear Entertainment is committed to family fun and above all, safety. They've spent a small fortune on these new animatronics, uh, facial recognition, advanced mobility. They even let them walk around during the day! Heh, isn't that neat? Ahem. But most importantly, they're all tied into some kind of criminal database, so they can detect a predator a mile away. Heck, we should be paying them to guard you!”
Jeremy felt uncomfortable after that last line. It felt like the phone guy was foreshadowing something bad was going to happen.
“Uh, now that being said, no new system's without its.. kinks. Uh, you're only the second guard to work at that location. Uh, the first guy finished his week, but complained about.. conditions. Uh, we switched him over to the day shift. So, hey, lucky you, right? Uh, mainly he expressed concern that certain characters seemed to move around at night, and even attempted to get into his office. Now, from what we know, that should be impossible. Uh, that restaurant should be the safest place on earth. So while our engineers don't really have an explanation for this, the working theory is that the robots were never given a proper night mode. So when it gets quiet, they think they're in the wrong room, so then they go try to find where the people are, and in this case, that's your office. So our temporary solution is this. There's a music box over by the prize counter, and it's rigged to be wound up remotely. So just every once in a while, switch over to the prize counter video feed and wind it up for a few seconds. It doesn't seem to affect all of the animatronics, but it does affect one of them, ahem. Uh, and as for the rest of them, we have an even easier solution. You see, there may be a minor glitch in the system, something about robots seeing you as an endoskeleton without his costume on and wanting to stuff you into a suit. So hey, we've given you an empty Freddy Fazbear head. Problem solved! You can put it on anytime and leave it on for as long as you want. Eventually anything that wandered in, will wander back out.”
Jeremy went pale. Absolutely none of that sounded good. The way the phone guy was really hesitant about his words, and how he said “uh” and “ahem” a lot, and the fact that he talked about the animatronics wanting to kill him was really starting to creep Jeremy out. He began to realise why they didn’t pay a lot.
“Uh, something else worth mentioning is kind of the quirky modern design of the building. You may have noticed there are no doors for you to close, heh. Uh, but hey, you have a light! And even though your flashlight can run out of power, the building cannot. So, don't worry about the place going dark. Well I think that's it. Uh, you should be golden. Uh, check the lights, put on the Freddy head if you need to, uh, keep the music box wound up, piece of cake. Have a good night, and I'll talk to you tomorrow.”
Jeremy was beginning to have second thoughts about this job. Was it the right idea? The way the phone guy put it made it sound like a death wish.
